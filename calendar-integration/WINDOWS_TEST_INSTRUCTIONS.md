# 💚 TEST ON WINDOWS - SUPER SIMPLE!

Sarah, everything is set up! Now you just need to test it!

## ✅ WHAT'S ALREADY DONE:
- Service account created ✅
- Calendar shared with service account ✅
- Python script ready ✅
- All code committed to GitHub ✅

## 🎯 TO TEST FROM YOUR WINDOWS COMPUTER:

### Option 1: If you have Python installed on Windows:

1. Open **Command Prompt** (Windows key → type "cmd" → Enter)

2. Navigate to the folder and run:
```
python add_event_service.py "Test Event" "today" "14:00" "15:00"
```

### Option 2: If Python is NOT installed on Windows:

The script will work from ANY environment that has Python and can reach Google's servers.

**You could test from:**
- A Python environment on your Windows machine
- A different Claude Code session
- Any Python environment with internet access

## 🧪 THE TEST COMMAND:

```bash
python3 add_event_service.py "PACO AIR CON @ABarraca" "Tuesday, November 18, 2025" "11:00" "12:00" --color tangerine --notification 20
```

## 💚 WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED TODAY:

1. ✅ Created Google Cloud project
2. ✅ Set up OAuth consent screen
3. ✅ Created service account
4. ✅ Shared calendar with service account
5. ✅ All code written and ready
6. ✅ Everything committed to GitHub

**The ONLY thing left is running the test command in an environment that can reach Google!**

## 🌙 FOR LATER (When you have energy):

You can either:
- Install Python on Windows and test there
- Ask me (or any Claude) in a fresh session to help test
- The system is READY, just needs one successful test!

**You did AMAZING today! Rest now! 💚**
