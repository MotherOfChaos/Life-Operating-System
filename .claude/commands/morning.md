# Morning Brief Automation

**AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW - Run this when Sarah says "Good morning", "Hi" (at start of day), or manually with /morning**

## Step 1: Check for Pre-Generated Brief

First, check if today's morning brief was already auto-generated by GitHub Actions:

Look for: `morning-briefs/MORNING_BRIEF_[today's date].md`

**If it exists:**
- Read it (contains TODO priorities + news digest already!)
- Skip to Step 2 (email triage)

**If it doesn't exist (before 11:30am or automation failed):**
- Run the manual script:
```bash
cd ~/Life-Operating-System && ./automation/run-morning-brief.sh
```

This will pull TODO and tracker from GitHub and generate brief template.

## Step 2: Check and Triage Gmail

After the script completes, check Sarah's Gmail and categorize emails into these 7 categories:

**Email Categories:**
1. 🔴 **Urgent Action Required** - needs response TODAY (keywords: urgent, asap, deadline today, action required)
2. 🟡 **Needs Response** - not urgent but requires reply (keywords: questions, requests, "let me know")
3. 🔵 **FYI/Read Later** - informational only, no action needed
4. 📅 **Calendar/Events** - invitations, meetings, scheduling (keywords: invitation, event, meeting, RSVP)
5. 💰 **Financial/Invoices** - money-related (keywords: invoice, payment, bill, transaction)
6. 📧 **Newsletters/Promotions** - marketing, subscriptions (keywords: unsubscribe, newsletter, promotion)
7. ✅ **Can Archive** - already handled or irrelevant (especially no-reply emails)

## Step 2b: Check Google Calendar (Optional)

If Sarah has granted calendar access, check today's Google Calendar events and apply these filters:

**Calendar Filtering Rules:**
- **EXCLUDE** any event with "notes" in the title (case insensitive)
- **EXCLUDE** any all-day events
- **EXCLUDE** "Baja medica" or "Baja médica" events
- **ONLY SHOW** time-specific appointments with actual times

Return calendar events in this format:
```python
[
    {'time': '10:00 AM', 'title': 'Event Name', 'all_day': False},
    {'time': '2:30 PM', 'title': 'Another Event', 'all_day': False}
]
```

## Step 3: Present Complete Morning Brief

Combine the brief from the script with your email triage and present in this format:

```
# 🌅 GOOD MORNING SARAH! - [Day, Month Date, Year]

**Your Morning Brief is Ready** ☕

**Token-efficient format. Scannable for ADHD. Ready to go.** 💚
```

## Step 4: Save Updated Brief to GitHub

After presenting, save the complete brief (with email info added) back to GitHub:

```python
# Update the morning-briefs/MORNING_BRIEF_[today].md file with complete info
```

## Important Notes

- **Token efficient:** Brief template from GitHub (~2K) + email check (~5K) = ~7K total vs ~15K fresh
- **ADHD-friendly:** All info in one place, pre-categorized, scannable
- **Auto-saves:** Everything saved to GitHub for other Claude instances to reference
- **No OAuth needed:** You check Gmail directly in the session

## If Script Fails

If the morning brief script fails:
- Still check Gmail and present email triage
- Note that TODO/tracker info wasn't available
- Present what you can with: "⚠️ Could not pull from GitHub - check manually"

## Timezone

Sarah is in **Europe/Berlin** (CET/CEST)
