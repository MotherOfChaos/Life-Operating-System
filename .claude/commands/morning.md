---

# Morning Brief Automation

**CRITICAL - AUTO-TRIGGER:** When Sarah says "Good morning", "Morning", "Good morning M", or "Hi M" at the start of the day, AUTOMATICALLY execute this entire workflow WITHOUT her having to type /morning. She should just be able to say "Good morning" (even with voice input!) and get her complete brief.

**AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW - Run this when:**
- Sarah says "Good morning" (any variation)
- Sarah says "Morning" or "Morning M"
- Sarah manually types /morning

## Step 1: Fetch Today's Morning Brief from GitHub

**CRITICAL FOR ADHD:** This must work from phone/web/desktop with ZERO manual steps from Sarah!

**Determine today's date in Sarah's timezone:**
- Sarah is in Europe/Madrid (CET/CEST)
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-11-30)

**Fetch the morning brief via GitHub API:**

```
URL: https://api.github.com/repos/MotherOfChaos/Life-Operating-System/contents/morning-briefs/MORNING_BRIEF_[today's date].md

Headers:
  Authorization: token [GH_PAT from CLAUDE_PROJECTS_INSTRUCTIONS.md]
  Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw
```

**If fetch succeeds:**
- Parse the morning brief content
- Extract TOP 5 priorities
- Note the news digest section
- Continue to Step 2 (email triage)

**If fetch fails (404 - file doesn't exist):**
- The automation hasn't run yet (before 08:30 CET)
- Tell Sarah: "⏰ Morning brief not ready yet - automation runs at 08:30 CET. I can check your email now if you'd like?"
- Offer to do email triage anyway

**If fetch fails (auth error):**
- Tell Sarah: "⚠️ GitHub token issue - please ask Cody to check the setup"
- Do NOT expose token details

## Step 1b: Generate News Digest (Using Web Search - FREE!)

**IMPORTANT:** Use your web_search tool to generate today's news. This uses Claude Pro tokens (FREE), NOT the paid API.

**Instructions:**

1. **Search today's news** from Sarah's priority sources:
   - 🇪🇸 **Spain** (search in Spanish!): El País, El Diario, Público
   - 🇮🇹 **Italy**: ANSA, La Repubblica, Corriere della Sera
   - 🌍 **Europe/World**: BBC, Reuters, AFP
   - 🎭 **Arts/Culture**: The Guardian culture, arts sections
   - 🧠 **Science**: BBC Science, major discoveries

2. **Focus on Sarah's interests (priority order):**
   - Spain/Barcelona news (HIGH)
   - Italy news (HIGH)
   - Europe/EU news (HIGH)
   - Arts & Culture (theater, museums, events)
   - Science (neuroscience, psychology, breakthroughs)
   - Tech/Business (AI, major dev only)
   - Skip sports unless major

3. **Present as concise TL;DR (3-5 bullets):**
   - SCANNABLE for ADHD
   - Separate [Fact] from [Opinion]
   - Actionable/interesting info only

**Format:**
```
## 📰 NEWS TL;DR

🇪🇸 **Spain:** [Fact] Major development...
🇮🇹 **Italy:** [Fact] Event in Rome...
🌍 **World:** [Fact] EU announces...
🎭 **Culture:** Barcelona theater...
🧠 **Science:** Discovery in neuroscience...
```

## Step 2: Check and Triage Gmail

After fetching the brief and generating news, check Sarah's Gmail and categorize emails into these 7 categories:

After fetching the morning brief, check Sarah's Gmail and categorize emails into these 7 categories:

**Email Categories:**
1. 🔴 **Urgent Action Required** - needs response TODAY (keywords: urgent, asap, deadline today, action required)
2. 🟡 **Needs Response** - not urgent but requires reply (keywords: questions, requests, "let me know")
3. 🔵 **FYI/Read Later** - informational only, no action needed
4. 📅 **Calendar/Events** - invitations, meetings, scheduling (keywords: invitation, event, meeting, RSVP)
5. 💰 **Financial/Invoices** - money-related (keywords: invoice, payment, bill, transaction)
6. 📧 **Newsletters/Promotions** - marketing, subscriptions (keywords: unsubscribe, newsletter, promotion)
7. ✅ **Can Archive** - already handled or irrelevant (especially no-reply emails)

## Step 2b: Check Google Calendar (Optional)

If Sarah has granted calendar access, check today's Google Calendar events and apply these filters:

**Calendar Filtering Rules:**
- **EXCLUDE** any event with "notes" in the title (case insensitive)
- **EXCLUDE** any all-day events
- **EXCLUDE** "Baja medica" or "Baja médica" events
- **ONLY SHOW** time-specific appointments with actual times

Return calendar events in this format:
```python
[
    {'time': '10:00 AM', 'title': 'Event Name', 'all_day': False},
    {'time': '2:30 PM', 'title': 'Another Event', 'all_day': False}
]
```

## Step 3: Present Complete Morning Brief

Combine the brief from the script with your email triage and present in this format:

```
# 🌅 GOOD MORNING SARAH! - [Day, Month Date, Year]

**Your Morning Brief is Ready** ☕

```

## Step 4: Save Updated Brief to GitHub

After presenting, save the complete brief (with email info added) back to GitHub:

```python
# Update the morning-briefs/MORNING_BRIEF_[today].md file with complete info
```

## Important Notes

- **Token efficient:** Brief template from GitHub (~2K) + email check (~5K) = ~7K total vs ~15K fresh
- **ADHD-friendly:** All info in one place, pre-categorized, scannable
- **Auto-saves:** Everything saved to GitHub for other Claude instances to reference
- **No OAuth needed:** You check Gmail directly in the session

## If Script Fails

If the morning brief script fails:
- Still check Gmail and present email triage
- Note that TODO/tracker info wasn't available
- Present what you can with: "⚠️ Could not pull from GitHub - check manually"

## Timezone

Sarah is in **Europe/Berlin** (CET/CEST)
