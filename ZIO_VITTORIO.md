# ZIO VITTORIO - BARCELONA FLAT PURCHASE PROJECT

**Always updated, never create new versions**  
**Last updated:** December 28, 2025  
**Deadline:** January 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### YOUR SITUATION:
- **Goal:** Passive income from rental property + exit strategy from Can Booty
- **Funding:** Uncle Vittorio providing lump sum (amount TBD)
- **Current properties:** 
  1. Valencia (Dad lives there)
  2. Malnom Barcelona center (empadronada, friends rent undeclared)
  3. Can Booty (GARDEN OF JOY S.L. - shared ownership nightmare)
- **Status:** On sick leave (baja medica) - affects mortgage eligibility
- **Solution:** Willing to declare Malnom income to strengthen mortgage application

---

## 4 OPTIONS ANALYZED

### OPTION A: Ready-to-Live 1-Bedroom (Pure rental income)
- Buy finished 1-bedroom flat
- Rent out immediately
- Simplest, fastest option
- No refurbishment headaches
- Monthly rental income: ~€1,000

### OPTION B: 2-Bedroom with Extra Room (SARAH'S PREFERRED!)
- Extra room for Sarah (saves taxi money from teatro late nights)
- Calculate taxi costs last 2 years → mortgage offset
- More space = higher rental value (~€1,300/month when rented)
- Exit strategy from Can Booty built-in
- **WIN-WIN:** Passive income + personal use when needed

### OPTION C: 2 Small Studios (Higher yield potential)
- One for Sarah, one to rent
- May need refurbishment
- More complex management
- Higher potential returns (~€2,000/month combined)
- Most expensive option (€335K all-in for two)

### OPTION D+: Commercial/Office Space (CREATIVE SOLUTION!)

This option has **multiple sub-models** - each progressively more innovative:

#### D1: Traditional Commercial Rental
- Buy commercial space
- Register as LAS TIAS DEL SEC office (tax deductible)
- Rent part/all to company via agency
- Less hassle, independent entries
- Fixed monthly income (~€700/month for small office)
- Professional tenant (B2B = more stable)
- Sleep there "occasionally"
- **Advantage:** Lower purchase price than residential

#### D2: Co-Working Manager Partnership - FIXED RENT MODEL
- Buy larger commercial/mixed-use space
- Find friend to live there & manage co-working
- Friend pays Sarah fixed rent
- Friend keeps all co-working profits
- Sarah sleeps there when needed (late teatro nights)
- Friend handles day-to-day management
- **Advantage:** Hands-off management for Sarah

#### D3: Co-Working Manager Partnership - REVENUE SHARE MODEL (RECOMMENDED!)
**This is the most innovative option:**

- Buy larger space (2-3BR or commercial with living area)
- **Find friend to live there & manage co-working**
- **Friend lives for FREE** (bedroom + shared bathroom/kitchenette)
- Friend manages co-working space & works from "home"
- Sarah sleeps there occasionally (2 bedrooms total - one for Sarah, one for manager)
- **Revenue split formula:** `(Total co-working income ÷ 2) - (€500-€700 for housing value)`
- Both benefit: Friend gets free housing + income, Sarah gets passive income + occasional crash pad

**POTENTIAL MANAGER-FRIENDS:**
- **LAZA** - possibly interested
- **PETER K** - possibly interested  
- **CHARLIE** - possibly interested

**ASSISTANT MODEL (scalability layer):**
- Manager can hire assistant to open/close + manage space when traveling
- Assistant compensation: **Free desk in co-working space** (no cash salary needed)
- Ensures continuity when manager is away
- Lower overhead
- **Very smart!** Manager doesn't have to be there 24/7

**This creates self-sustaining ecosystem:**
1. Sarah: Property owner, occasional resident, passive income
2. Manager-friend: Free housing, co-working business income, flexibility to travel
3. Assistant: Free workspace, part-time management duties
4. Co-working members: Reliable space with consistent management

**INCOME POTENTIAL:**
- 10 dedicated desks @ €300 = €3,000/month
- 5 hot desks @ €175 = €875/month
- Meeting room rentals: €500/month
- **Total potential: €4,375/month**
- **Sarah's share (after manager):** ~€1,500-€2,000/month

## FINANCING STRATEGIES - BANK VS. VITTORIO

### OPTION 1: Bank Mortgage (Traditional Route)

**Sarah's Challenge:**
- Sick leave = No current income proof
- Spanish banks require 6 months payslips minimum
- Being on baja medica = red flag for lenders

**Solutions to Strengthen Application:**
1. **Declare Malnom income NOW** - Build 6-month track record
2. **Use properties as collateral** - Valencia flat, Malnom flat
3. **Larger down payment** - Reduce bank's risk

**Typical Mortgage Terms (if Sarah qualifies):**
- Down payment: 20-30% required
- Interest rates: 3-4% variable, 3.5-4.5% fixed
- Term: Up to 30 years
- **Monthly payment example:** €200K loan @ 3.5% for 25 years = ~€1,000/month
- **RISK: Property can be foreclosed if payments missed** ⚠️

### OPTION 2: Vittorio Financing (RECOMMENDED!)

**Compare these scenarios:**

#### Scenario A: Bank Mortgage
- Vittorio pays: €150K (lump sum)
- Bank mortgage: €75K
- Interest rate: ~3.5%
- Monthly payment to bank: ~€375
- Total interest paid over 25 years: ~€37,500
- **RISK: Foreclosure if can't pay**

#### Scenario B: Vittorio Covers Gap
- Vittorio pays: €225K (full amount OR larger portion)
- Sarah pays back: €75K to Vittorio over time
- Interest rate: 0% OR lower than bank (family rate)
- Monthly payment to Vittorio: €250 (flexible, negotiable)
- Total interest paid: €0 OR minimal
- **RISK: Much lower - Vittorio won't foreclose!**
- **BONUS: Money could go into account for Kiki's future** (generational wealth building)

**ADVANTAGES OF VITTORIO FINANCING:**
1. **Security:** No foreclosure risk - family flexibility
2. **Cost savings:** Zero or minimal interest vs. €37,500+ to bank
3. **Flexibility:** Payment terms negotiable based on rental income
4. **Speed:** No bank approval process (Sarah is on sick leave)
5. **Family wealth:** Money stays in family, builds Kiki's future fund
6. **Tax benefits:** Potentially structure as family loan

**PRESENTATION TO VITTORIO:**

**Frame as INVESTMENT, not handout:**
- Passive income for Sarah (financial independence)
- Can Booty exit strategy (safety net from toxic situation)
- Property in Barcelona (appreciating asset - Barcelona real estate strong)
- Family wealth building (can stay in family long-term)
- Sarah's professional stability (reduces stress, supports her work)
- **Kiki fund angle:** Generational wealth, supporting niece's autonomy

**PAYBACK SCENARIOS TO SHOW VITTORIO:**

If rental income = €1,300/month:
- Pay Vittorio €300/month = 20 years to repay €75K
- Sarah keeps €1,000/month for expenses

If co-working income = €4,375/month, Sarah's share ~€2,000:
- Pay Vittorio €500/month = 12.5 years to repay €75K
- Sarah keeps €1,500/month

**Show him it's sustainable and you're serious about paying back.**

---

## REFURBISHMENT COSTS

### Light Refurbishment (cosmetic):
- **€200-400/m²**
- Paint, flooring, basic updates
- Timeline: 1-2 months

### Medium Refurbishment:
- **€400-700/m²**
- Kitchen, bathroom, some structural work
- Timeline: 2-4 months

### Full Gut Renovation:
- **€800-1,200/m²**
- Everything redone from scratch
- Timeline: 4-6 months

### Example: 60m² flat
- Light: €12,000-24,000
- Medium: €24,000-42,000
- Full: €48,000-72,000

**FACTOR THIS INTO BUDGET** if looking at fixer-uppers!

---

## TAX IMPLICATIONS

### Property Ownership Tax (IRPF):

Sarah already pays on:
1. Valencia flat (Dad lives - imputed rent)
2. Malnom flat (undeclared rental - **LEGAL RISK!**)
3. Can Booty (S.L. owned - different structure)

**Adding 4th property:**
- More imputed rent added to IRPF
- OR actual rental income declared (if renting it out)
- Tax bracket: Depends on total income

### Declaring Malnom Income:

**PROS:**
- Legal (eliminates current risk!)
- Mortgage application boost (proven income stream)
- Professional tax image
- Can deduct expenses (repairs, IBI, community fees)

**CONS:**
- Additional tax on rental income
- May need to regularize/backpay if questioned

### Commercial vs Residential Ownership:

**PERSONAL OWNERSHIP:**
- Rental income taxed as IRPF
- Capital gains tax on eventual sale
- Simpler structure
- Direct control

**S.L. OWNERSHIP (LAS TIAS DEL SEC):**
- **PROS:** Corporate tax (25% flat vs progressive IRPF), more expense deductions, professional image
- **CONS:** More accounting/admin, annual filings mandatory, if S.L. has debts/liabilities, property could be at risk
- **CRITICAL QUESTION:** Is LAS TIAS DEL SEC unipersonal? If Fergie is still partner, she has potential claims!

**RESEARCH STILL NEEDED:** Unipersonal conversion costs, liability protection details

---

## LICENSING & LEGAL QUESTIONS TO RESEARCH

**Important questions for Spanish business lawyer/gestor:**

1. **IAE/CNAE codes:** What activities are allowed under LAS TIAS DEL SEC's current registration?

2. **Office rental licensing:** Does Sarah need special license to rent office space to others as a business activity?

3. **Artist residency angle:** Can Sarah add "artist residency" activity to LAS TIAS DEL SEC to justify beds in office space? (Creative solution for "why are there beds here" question)

4. **International production justification:** As production company working with USA/Australia = legitimate reason for overnight presence in office? (Time zone differences = someone working at night makes business sense)

5. **Legal vs. "commonly done":** 
   - What's technically required by law?
   - What do people actually do in practice?
   - What are the realistic risks/fines if caught?
   - Which infractions are minor vs. major?

6. **Cedula de habitabilidad:** Can office spaces be converted to residential? What's the process, cost, timeline for getting habitability certification? Which office spaces are convertible vs. impossible?

**This is clever thinking!** Artist residency = beds justified. International production = night presence justified. May create legal workarounds for mixed-use space.

---

## RECOMMENDED STRATEGY

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 2 weeks):

1. **Get Vittorio's exact budget commitment**
   - How much lump sum can he provide?
   - Any conditions or expectations?
   - Timeline for transfer?
   - Is he open to covering full amount vs. Sarah getting mortgage?

2. **Calculate taxi expenses (last 2 years)**
   - Teatro late nights → Can Booty
   - Shows how much Sarah could save with city center room
   - Justifies mortgage for 2BR option
   - Demonstrates business case to Vittorio

3. **Decision: Declare Malnom income or not?**
   - If need mortgage from bank: YES, start NOW
   - If Vittorio covers 100%: Can delay, but reduces legal risk anyway
   - Either way, good for professional tax image

4. **Research S.L. vs personal ownership**
   - Check LAS TIAS DEL SEC current structure (is Fergie still involved?)
   - Unipersonal conversion costs if needed
   - Liability protection analysis
   - Tax implications comparison

5. **Draft email template for real estate agencies**
   - Explain what you're looking for (residential OR commercial)
   - Ask about off-market properties (pipeline deals)
   - Ask about office→residential conversion possibilities
   - Mention serious buyer with financing ready

### TIMELINE RECOMMENDATION:

**NOW → March 2025:**
- Declare Malnom income (if pursuing mortgage route)

- Research neighborhoods & properties actively
- Send agency emails
- Get Vittorio's firm commitment

| Option | Purchase Price | All-In Cost | Monthly Income | Sarah Can Use? | Management | Vittorio Amount Needed |
|--------|---------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| **A: 1BR Ready** | €180K | €200K | €1,000 | No | Low | €200K (no mortgage) |

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**OPTION D3: Co-Working Manager Partnership (Revenue Share Model)**

**OR if Vittorio prefers simpler:**

**OPTION B: 2BR with Sarah's Room**

### Why Option D3 (Co-Working) is BEST:

1. **Highest income potential:** €1,500-€2,000/month to Sarah (vs €1,000-€1,300 for simple rental)
2. **Lowest management burden:** Friend handles everything
3. **Sarah can still use it:** Late teatro nights, Can Booty escape
4. **Scalable model:** Assistant system for continuity
5. **Creative/professional space:** Aligns with Sarah's teatro/artistic work
6. **Community building:** Network of creative professionals
7. **Tax advantages:** Business operation under LAS TIAS DEL SEC

### Why Option B (2BR) is SOLID BACKUP:

1. **Simpler to execute:** Traditional rental, well-understood
2. **Still gives Sarah access:** Exit from Can Booty + late night crash pad
3. **Good income:** €1,300/month when rented
4. **Lower complexity:** No partner/manager needed
5. **Easier to explain to Vittorio:** Traditional real estate investment

### Proposed Budget (either option):

- **Property purchase price:** €220K
- **All-in with costs:** €245K
- **Vittorio provides:** €150K-€200K
- **Small mortgage OR Vittorio covers gap:** €45K-€95K
- **Monthly payment:** €200-€400/month
- **Paid by rental/co-working income:** YES, sustainable!

- Explain serious buyer with financing ready
- Best properties never hit Idealista
- Early access = better negotiating position

- **Research needed:** Legal requirements, costs, timeline, which spaces qualify

### Multi-Income Streams (Co-Working Model):

---

## RED FLAGS TO WATCH

1. **Going over 300K budget** - 280K property = ~310K all-in (too much!)
2. **Buying before declaring Malnom** - Weak mortgage position, legal risk continues
3. **S.L. ownership without research** - Liability risks unclear, Fergie complications
4. **Ignoring refurbishment costs** - Can blow budget fast (€50K+ easily)
5. **Tourist rental dreams** - Barcelona has killed this market, don't count on it
6. **Pietro buying Martino's share at Can Booty** - Timeline pressure, need exit strategy faster
