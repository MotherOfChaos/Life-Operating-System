## 📈 PATTERNS EMERGING

### Sleep:
- **Philoux effect confirmed:** After 3 days, sleep routine disrupted
- **Excitement insomnia:** Big ideas (Cartas) keep brain active - happened Nov 23-24!
- **Execute-while-sleeping solution:** Capture with M → can let go → sleep works
- **Recovery sleep:** Body takes what it needs (17.5 hours!)
- **Action:** Added 3-day guest limit to ADHD toolkit in Life OS
- **Soluble Mirtazapina** - Works significantly faster than regular for sleep onset (Nov 18-19)
- **Inconsistent effectiveness:** Nov 19→20 horrible despite usual protocol - needs more tracking
- **Hyperfocus pattern:** Late night Cartas work (Nov 23-24) = excited brain = sleep delay BUT captured ideas so could sleep

### ADHD Management:
- Excited brain at night = capture idea immediately or can't let go ✅
- Execute-while-sleeping model = perfect for this ✅
- GitHub for version control = reduces anxiety about losing work ✅
- **Multi-channel system TOO COMPLEX** - Needs simplification urgently
- **Hyperfocus-crash pattern identified** - Nov 18 Claude Code day, classic example
- **Late Concerta timing** - Nov 19 took at 14:00, monitoring impact on sleep
- **Claude Projects = game changer** - Shared knowledge means less setup anxiety
- **Cartas hyperfocus** - 12 commits in one day = classic ADHD hyperfocus productivity burst
- **ADHD tax awareness** - Train ticket MUST be changed Nov 25 to avoid extra charges

### Medication:
- PA (Pilot) tracking daily now
- Meu's medications stable - removed from daily tracking (consistent routine)
- Sleep protocol refined with soluble Mirtazapina but still variable results
- Quetiapina consistent timing ~03:00am range

### Projects:
- **Cartas en Vivo = major passion project** - Full strategic vision in 24 hours
- **Execute-while-sleeping working perfectly** - M researched, Sarah woke to progress
- **Physical outreach strategy** - Can Booty books = brilliant tactile approach
- **Goya Awards timing** - Feb 28, 2026 = 3 months away, perfect window
- **Teatro negotiations active** - Peter K investment discussions ongoing
