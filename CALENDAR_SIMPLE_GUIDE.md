# 🗓️ CALENDAR - HOW TO USE (SIMPLE VERSION)

**Last updated:** November 18, 2025 - Night cleanup

---

## ✅ WHAT WORKS RIGHT NOW:

**Google Apps Script API** - works from Claude.ai when you include the URL!

**Your API URL:**
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwsQmuvufHqGncpuln6JE9dINsEKe2ROwDfcuXpBakqtwQ98GokTpeiAQCoAVVs05U3/exec
```

---

## 📱 HOW TO USE FROM CLAUDE.AI (PHONE OR WEB):

**Say this:**

```
Add to my calendar: [event name], on [YYYY-MM-DD], from [HH:MM] to [HH:MM], color [colorname], notification [X] minutes before

My calendar API: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwsQmuvufHqGncpuln6JE9dINsEKe2ROwDfcuXpBakqtwQ98GokTpeiAQCoAVVs05U3/exec
```

**Example:**
```
Add to my calendar: Doctor appointment, on 2025-11-28, from 16:00 to 17:30, color banana, notification 60 minutes before

My calendar API: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwsQmuvufHqGncpuln6JE9dINsEKe2ROwDfcuXpBakqtwQ98GokTpeiAQCoAVVs05U3/exec
```

## 🎨 AVAILABLE COLORS:

lavender, sage, grape, flamingo, **banana**, tangerine, peacock, graphite, blueberry, basil, tomato

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

- **Only ONE notification** supported right now (not multiple)
- **Use YYYY-MM-DD format** for dates to avoid confusion (e.g., 2025-06-06)
- **Use 24-hour time** (16:00, not 4pm)
- **Must include the API URL** each time you ask (until we fix Claude.ai memories)

---

## 🔧 WHAT STILL NEEDS FIXING:

- [ ] Multiple notifications support
- [ ] Shorter memory format for Claude.ai
- [ ] Better natural language parsing
- [ ] Date/day-of-week accuracy

---

## 💚 FOR TOMORROW:

Test with ONE simple event to make sure it still works!

**Everything else is in `calendar-integration/` folder - but you don't need to look at it unless something breaks!**
