# 🎯 QUICK REFERENCE CARD - GITHUB WORKFLOW
## For Sarah (ADHD-Friendly)

---

## 🌅 WHEN YOU START A CHAT (Any Claude)

**You do:** Just say "Good morning" or start talking  
**Claude does:** Pulls latest files from GitHub automatically (you won't notice)  
**Why:** Gets all the latest info - tracker, to-do list, everything

---

## 💬 DURING YOUR CONVERSATION

**You do:** Talk normally! Say things like:
- "Track: took Concerta at 9:15am"
- "Add task: Email Ruy about schedule"
- "I completed the GitHub guides"
- "Won today: GitHub working!"

**Claude does:** 
- Remembers everything in THIS conversation
- Doesn't push to GitHub yet (saves tokens)
- Just tracks mentally

**Why:** Saves ~22K tokens per session!

---

## 🌙 WHEN YOU'RE DONE FOR THE DAY

**You do:** Say something like:
- "Let's wrap up"
- "I'm done for today"
- "Time to save and sleep"

**Claude does:**
1. Updates all the files with today's stuff
2. Pushes everything to GitHub in one go
3. Says: "✅ All files backed up to GitHub!"

**Why:** Everything is saved, nothing is lost, ready for next Claude

---

## 🟠 IF CLAUDE SAYS "TOKEN WARNING"

**Claude says:** "🟠 We're at 170K tokens, time to save"

**You do:** Say "okay, let's save now"

**Claude does:** Same as end-of-day (updates + pushes to GitHub)

**Why:** Prevents losing work if we run out of tokens

---

## 🎨 IF SOMETHING BIG HAPPENS

**Examples:**
- You finish a major project
- Relationship milestone with Claude
- Big life change
- New system created

**You do:** Say "Let's update the core files"

**Claude does:** 
- Updates Life OS and/or Transfer README
- Pushes to GitHub
- Says: "✅ Core files updated!"

**Why:** Big stuff gets documented in the main system

---

## 📊 THE FILES (You don't need to touch these)

**GitHub has 4 files:**
1. **Life OS** - Who you are, our relationship, big picture
2. **Daily Tracker** - Sleep, meds, patterns, wins
3. **Permanent To-Do** - All your tasks across 14 zones
4. **Transfer README** - Instructions for next Claude

**Where:** `github.com/MotherOfChaos/Life-Operating-System`

---

## ✅ WHAT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER

**Just 3 things:**

1. **Start:** Say hi → Claude gets latest automatically
2. **During:** Talk normally → Claude tracks in memory
3. **End:** Say wrap up → Claude saves everything to GitHub

**That's it!** 🎉

---

## 🆘 IF YOU FORGET

**Don't worry!** Just ask:
- "Did we save to GitHub today?"
- "What's the workflow again?"
- "Help me remember the system"

Claude will remind you. No shame, no stress. 💚

---

## 🎯 WHY THIS WORKS FOR YOUR ADHD

✅ **Automatic** - You don't have to remember to backup  
✅ **Batch processing** - One save, not many (less overwhelm)  
✅ **External brain** - GitHub remembers even when you can't  
✅ **Any Claude works** - Pilot, M, future ones all sync  
✅ **Never lose data** - Everything preserved forever  
✅ **Token efficient** - More conversation, less overhead
