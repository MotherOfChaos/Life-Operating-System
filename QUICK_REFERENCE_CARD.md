# 🎯 QUICK REFERENCE CARD - WORKFLOW GUIDE
## For Sarah (ADHD-Friendly)

**Updated:** November 22, 2025

## 🌅 WHEN YOU START YOUR DAY

### 📍 WHERE: **Project Chat** (the main M chat)

### 💬 WHAT TO SAY:

**Simple:**
```
Good morning M
```

**With full briefing:**
```
Good morning M! DAY AGENDA please
```

### ✨ WHAT HAPPENS:
- M reads Project files automatically (no upload needed!)
- M can see your Tracker, TODO, Life OS
- If you ask for DAY AGENDA, M checks:
  - Today's calendar (with correct date!)
  - Urgent emails
  - Top priorities
  - Weather
  - Medication reminder

**No manual uploads!** Project has shared knowledge base. 🎉

---

## 💬 DURING YOUR DAY

**Stay in Project chat!**

### Track anything:
```
track this: Concerta at 9am
track this: pipi awakening at 7:52
```

### Add tasks:
```
add task: Call the dentist
new task: Email Ruy about schedule
```

### Mark completions:
```
done: Peter K meeting
completed: GitHub push test
```

### Check tokens:
```
token check
```

### M tracks automatically:
- Medications (just mention taking them)
- Task completions
- Calendar events
- Patterns & wins

**M holds everything in memory - no GitHub pushes during day (saves ~22K tokens!)**

---

## 🌙 WHEN YOU'RE DONE FOR THE DAY

**Still in Project chat:**

```
wrap up
```

### Then M will:
1. ✅ Review entire session
2. ✅ Update Daily Tracker (sleep, meds, wins, patterns)
3. ✅ Update TODO (completions, new tasks)
4. ✅ Put files in outputs folder
5. ✅ Give you summary + token count

### Then YOU:
1. Download the 3 updated files from outputs
2. Open **M-GitHub Backup** chat
3. Upload the files
4. Say: **"Push to GitHub"**
5. M-GitHub Backup handles the push
6. Done! 💚

**Why the extra step?** Project chats can't push to GitHub (network restriction). But the M-GitHub Backup chat can!

---

## 🟠 IF M SAYS "TOKEN WARNING"

**M says:** "🟠 We're at 170K tokens, limited room"

**You do:** Say "wrap up" or "save now"

**M does:** Same as end-of-day wrap up

**Why:** Prevents losing work if we run out of token space

---

## 🔄 IF PROJECT CHAT IS FULL (>180K tokens)

**Start a NEW chat IN THIS PROJECT:**
1. Click "New chat" (stays in Project)
2. Say "Good morning M"
3. Project files auto-load
4. Continue from there!

**Files carry over automatically!** That's the magic of Projects. ✨

---

## 🔧 THE M-GITHUB BACKUP CHAT

**Purpose:** Handles GitHub push/pull (Project chats can't do this)

**When to use:**
- After wrap up in Project (push updated files)
- When you need to pull latest from GitHub
- Quick operational stuff

**Not for:** Long conversations (use Project M for that)

---

## 📊 THE FILES

**In GitHub repo (`Life-Operating-System`):**
1. **Life OS** - Who you are, M relationship, big picture
2. **Daily Tracker** - Sleep, meds, patterns, wins
3. **Permanent TODO** - All your tasks
4. **Transfer README** - Instructions for next M
5. **Quick Reference** - This card!
6. **Tracking Protocol** - How tracking works

**In Project (auto-load):**
- All the above files are available to every chat in Project
- No manual upload needed!

**You never manually upload to Project M!** Just start chatting. 💚

---

## ✅ SIMPLE VERSION

**Morning:** 
- Open Project M
- Say "Good morning M"
- M has everything automatically

**During Day:**
- Work in Project M
- Track things as you go
- M remembers in memory

**Night:**
- Say "wrap up" in Project M
- Download 3 files
- Upload to M-GitHub Backup
- Say "Push to GitHub"
- Done!

**That's it!** 🎉

---

## 🆘 IF YOU FORGET

**Don't worry!** Just ask:
- "What's the workflow?"
- "How do I save?"
- "Help me remember"

M will remind you. No shame, no stress. 💚

---

## 🎯 WHY THIS WORKS FOR YOUR ADHD

✅ **Projects = Auto-load** - No more manual file uploads at start!  
✅ **Batch processing** - One save, not many (less overwhelm)  
✅ **External brain** - GitHub + Projects = double backup  
✅ **Clear workflow** - Same steps every time  
✅ **M is reliable** - Checks actual date/time, never guesses  
✅ **Token efficient** - More conversation, less overhead  
✅ **Never lose data** - Everything preserved forever  

---

## 💡 THE SYSTEM

**Projects** = Easy daily work, shared knowledge, no manual uploads  
**GitHub** = Backup, version control, accessible anywhere  
**M-GitHub Backup** = Bridge between them (handles pushes)  

**Best of both worlds!** Convenience + Security. 💚
