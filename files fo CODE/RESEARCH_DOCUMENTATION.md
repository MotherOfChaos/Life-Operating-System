## SPECIAL NOTES

**User Context (Mother Of Chaos):**

**Geographic Priorities:**
1. Spain (Barcelona local + national)
2. Italy (heritage)
3. Europe (EU-wide, war concerns, NATO)
4. Global major events

**Topic Priorities:**
1. Big world news (politics, conflicts)

## FACT-CHECKING METHODOLOGY

For Claude Skill implementation:

1. **Identify key claims** in articles
2. **Search across political spectrum** - minimum 3 sources with different leans
3. **Check consistency** - do facts match across sources?
4. **Separate fact from opinion**:
   - FACT: Events occurred, statements made (with attribution), published data
   - OPINION: "This will lead to...", "experts say...", predictions, value judgments
5. **Note disagreements** - when sources disagree on basic facts (rare for legitimate news)
6. **Geographic cross-check** - Compare European vs American perspectives
7. **Present to user**: Factual core + range of interpretations

**Red Flags for Opinion Dressed as Fact:**
- Emotionally loaded language
- Unattributed claims ("sources say")
- Future predictions
- "Likely" or "probably" statements
