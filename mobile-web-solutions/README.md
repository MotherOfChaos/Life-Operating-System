# 📱 Mobile & Web Automation Solutions

**Making M accessible on ALL your devices, not just Desktop**

---

## 🎯 THE GOAL

Sarah uses Claude on multiple devices throughout the day:
- **Mobile:** Wake-up routines, bedtime check-ins, commute conversations
- **Web:** Quick tasks during work hours
- **Desktop:** Deep work, complex tasks (already automated ✅)

**The problem:** Desktop has full automation via `.claude/` folder. Mobile/Web don't.

## 🎓 HOW TO USE (After Setup)

### Morning Routine (Mobile)

**Desktop (already works):**
1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Say "Good morning"
3. Automation runs automatically ✅

**Mobile with iOS Shortcut:**
1. Wake up → Alarm stops → Shortcut runs automatically 🔔
2. Get notification: "Context copied!"
3. Open Claude → Paste → Send
4. M authenticates, runs morning brief 💚

**Mobile with Smart Template:**
1. Open Notes app
2. Copy "M Context Template"
3. Open Claude → Paste → Send
4. M authenticates 💚

**Web with Bookmarklet:**
1. Go to claude.ai/chat
2. Click "Load M Context" bookmark
3. Click Send
4. M authenticates 💚

### Quick Check-In (During Day)

**Any method works:**
- iOS Shortcut: Tap widget → Paste → Send
- Smart Template: Copy note → Paste
- Bookmarklet: Click bookmark → Send

**Then talk to M about:**
- Task updates
- Questions
- Quick wins
- Adjustments to plan

### Bedtime Protocol (Mobile)

**Perfect for voice mode:**
1. Load context (any method)
2. Tap microphone for voice mode
3. Talk through the day while lying in bed
4. M logs everything, tracks patterns
5. Say goodnight 💚🌙

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Combining with Voice Mode

After loading context, use Claude's voice mode for hands-free interaction:

1. Load M's context (1-2 steps)
2. Wait for authentication (10 sec)
3. Tap microphone icon
4. Talk hands-free! 🎙️

**Perfect for:**
- Getting ready in the morning (voice morning brief)
- Commute conversations (with headphones)
- Bedtime check-ins (lying in bed)
- Cooking/cleaning (hands busy)

### Multiple Device Strategy

**Set up all three methods:**
- Smart Template: Emergency backup, works everywhere
- iOS Shortcut: Primary method on phone
- Bookmarklet: Primary method on web

**Each optimized for its platform, zero friction across devices** 🎯

### Voice Commands (iOS)

**Set up multiple Siri phrases:**
- "Hey Siri, good morning M" → Runs shortcut
- "Hey Siri, load M" → Runs shortcut
- "Hey Siri, M context" → Runs shortcut

**Choose the phrase that feels natural to you**

### Automation Triggers (iOS)

**Beyond manual activation:**
- **Time-based:** Runs at 8:00 AM every day
- **Alarm-based:** Runs when you stop your morning alarm
- **Location-based:** Runs when you leave home/arrive at office
- **App-based:** Runs when you open Claude app

**Requires iOS Shortcuts app → Automation tab**

## 🔐 SECURITY NOTES

### Personal Access Token (PAT)

Your GitHub PAT appears in:
- iOS Shortcut code (stored locally on device)
- Bookmarklet code (stored locally in browser)
- Smart Template text (in Notes/Keep app)
- Claude chat history (if using Smart Template)

**This is generally safe because:**
- PAT only has read access to one private repo
- Your devices are password-protected
- You can revoke/regenerate anytime
- Local storage is more secure than cloud

**Best practices:**
- Don't share these tools with others
- Don't post screenshots showing PAT
- Regenerate PAT every 3-6 months
- Use strong device passwords
- Log out of Claude on shared devices

**To regenerate PAT:**
1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Revoke old token
3. Generate new token (needs `repo` scope)
4. Update Smart Template, iOS Shortcut, and Bookmarklet with new token

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Smart Template Issues

**"I can't fetch from GitHub"**
- Claude client may not have web fetch capabilities
- Use iOS Shortcut or Bookmarklet instead (they fetch locally)

**"403 Forbidden" or "401 Unauthorized"**
- PAT is invalid or expired
- Regenerate PAT from GitHub settings
- Update template with new PAT

### iOS Shortcut Issues

**"Untrusted Shortcut" warning**
- This is normal for shortcuts with web requests
- Settings → Shortcuts → Allow Running Scripts

**"Could not connect to GitHub"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify PAT is correct (no spaces)
- Test URLs in browser

**Shortcut doesn't run automatically**
- Check Automation settings
- Make sure "Ask Before Running" is OFF
- Check automation trigger conditions

### Bookmarklet Issues

**Nothing happens when I click**
- Make sure you're on claude.ai/chat
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Try a different browser (Chrome works best)

**"Could not find chat input"**
- Make sure chat input box is visible
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check if Claude UI has changed (bookmarklet may need update)

### General Issues

**Files are outdated**
- These tools fetch from GitHub `main` branch
- Make sure your CURRENT files are pushed to main
- Check GitHub web interface to verify files are latest

**Context is too large**
- Total files should be under ~50KB
- If larger, may need to split into multiple messages
- Or ask Claude to fetch files one at a time

## 🔮 FUTURE POSSIBILITIES

### If Anthropic Ships These Features

**Custom Instructions on Mobile** (like Desktop `.claude/` folder)
- Would eliminate need for our workarounds
- Monitor Anthropic release notes
- Migrate to official solution if/when available

**Projects with Auto-Sync**
- If Projects could sync with GitHub automatically
- Would be cleaner than our current approach
- Not available yet, but worth watching

**URL Deep Linking**
- If Claude adds `claude://new-chat?context=[url]` support
- Could trigger directly from other apps
- Not available yet

**MCP on Mobile**
- If Mobile gets MCP server support
- Could build proper integration
- Unlikely in near term (mobile apps are intentionally simplified)

### What We Can Do Now

**Keep using these workarounds until Anthropic ships better solutions.**

They work well, they're ADHD-friendly, and they get Sarah 85-95% of the way there.

**Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.** ✅
