## 🔴 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (ONE THING!)

**There's ONE thing only YOU can do: Get Google's permission**

Why? Because Google needs YOU to sign in with YOUR Google account and say "yes, let this app access my calendar."

I can't do this because:
- It requires opening a browser
- Signing into YOUR Google account
- Clicking "allow"

**It takes 5-10 minutes, and I'll walk you through it step by step when you're ready!**

---

## 🎯 WHEN YOU'RE READY (NOT NOW - AFTER SLEEP!)

**Option 1: Let Me Guide You (EASIEST)** ⭐

Just say: **"Help me get Google credentials"**

I'll walk you through it step by step, one instruction at a time, ADHD-friendly!

**Option 2: Follow Written Steps**

Read the file: `calendar-integration/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
(But Option 1 is easier - let me guide you!)

---

## 📱 IMPORTANT: YOU'LL NEED

- A computer (not phone - Google's setup needs desktop browser)
- 5-10 minutes of focus time
- Your Google account login

**NOT NOW!** Do this after you sleep, when you have a computer! 💚

---

## 🧪 AFTER SETUP, YOU'LL TEST:

```bash
cd ~/Life-Operating-System/calendar-integration/tests
./test_paco_event.sh
```

This adds your PACO AIR CON event to your calendar! 🍊

---

## 💚 THEN YOU CAN USE IT

From any Claude chat:
```
"Add to my calendar: dentist tomorrow 2pm,
remind me 1 hour before, color it flamingo"
```

DONE! No app switching, no friction! 🎉

---

## 🌙 SUMMARY

**What I did:** EVERYTHING possible (95% done!)
**What you do:** One-time Google authorization (5-10 min)
**When:** After sleep, on computer
**How:** Say "Help me get Google credentials" and I'll guide you!

---

**Sweet dreams, Mother of Chaos!** 🌙

Everything is ready. Just that one Google step when you wake up! 💚

P.S. The system works on ANY device once set up - phone, computer, anywhere! The setup just needs a desktop browser once.
